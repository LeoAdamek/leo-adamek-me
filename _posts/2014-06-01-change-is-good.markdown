Change is Good
==============

Change is a good thing, so here's some.
Starting today, by blog will reside on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Why you might ask? Didn't you switch from Wordpress to Joomla just a few months ago?
While this is true, the reason I never post is because of the hassle of logging into a CMS.
So now I'm going to use Jekyll to write my posts straight from my editor. _'nuff said_

I'll be importing my posts to this format soon. Stay tuned for their return.
